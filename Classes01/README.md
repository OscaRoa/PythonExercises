#Practice with basic Classes
Let's develop a simple app for DevF where we are going to create new devf des-students which can apply to devf program, so we could know which belt they belong, and also they can upgrade or downgrade their skills.

##So ... 

The des-students will have attributes like name, mail, skills, belt, etc ..
and each student can apply to the devf Application which has only 3 questions (you will decide it, be creative)

When a new des-student applies to a new Application, the program will asign them to the corresponding belt with this simple rule:

if the des-student answer JUST 1 correct question will assign White Belt
if there are 2 correct answers will assign Red Belt
and 3 ....Black Belt

The des-student also can upgrade or downgrade their skills. At the end we just need to see the des-student skills and assigned belt :D
